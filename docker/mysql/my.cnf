# CRITICAL: Ensure InnoDB is the default storage engine
# This is REQUIRED for your money transfer project because:
# 1. InnoDB supports ACID transactions (needed for preventing race conditions)
# 2. InnoDB supports row-level locking (lockForUpdate() in Laravel)
# 3. InnoDB supports foreign key constraints (for data integrity)

default-storage-engine = innodb

# Character set for better internationalization support
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

# Transaction isolation level
# READ-COMMITTED is a good balance for most applications
# It ensures each query sees only committed data
transaction-isolation = READ-COMMITTED

# Performance tuning for development
# Increase buffer pool size if you have RAM available
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 256M

# Log file size (can be smaller for development)
innodb_log_file_size = 64M
